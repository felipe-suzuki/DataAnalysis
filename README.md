# DataAnalysis-MortalityRate
I will be conducting a Data Analysis in data based on mortality from 2010 in Capao Bonito, Sao Paulo, Brazil looking at factors such as age, sex, race, and others. 

I am scraping the data, pre-processing, and filtering with MySQL. Then will import the data obtained to create data visualization with Tableau and apply statistical analysis using Python language.

I hope you enjoy it, thank you!

PS: I will be first using files in Portuguese (my mother language), then will translate and post all the files in English.
